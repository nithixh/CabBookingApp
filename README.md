# CabBookingApp
**A console-based Java Cab Booking System** with separate **User** and **Admin** modules. Users can sign up, log in, book cabs, and view rides, while admins can manage drivers, view all rides, and check reports. Built during a hackathon to simulate real-world ride-hailing applications.
